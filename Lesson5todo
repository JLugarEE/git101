So, after making a new branch and barely creating the commit and merge, and while initializing a local repo fetch, 
I realize that some user engagement might enhance learning. The unspoken example is to create/follow the [['Read
the guide']] example talked about.

The importance screamed out as I have just struggled using my repo 'git101' thru lessons 8, 6-8 not yet up loaded.
All because of the struggle to use the remote/web GUI interface and the git local CLI. What I found was that it is
easy to make simple examples, but when needing to make some repo on my own. I struggle to get it done. Git keeps
getting to me. However, I persevere.

My re-learning through my first 8 lessons is that:
1) git revisioning is done under the .git/ folder
2) adding files directly to the web remote GUI is very easy
3) syncing and working with a local and a remote is still cloudy
4) git CLI local commands are shaping up none-the-less
5) need to find the right command set guidelines to make local and remote syncing easier

Hoping to figure out how to implement some user engaging exercises, but my collaboration is very minimal.
TODO that.
