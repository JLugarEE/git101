So, let's take a breather and reflect on we we should know now.

Lessons 1-3 helped us:
1) to come to grips that git and gitHub can be confusing
2) running and explaining the [['Read the guide']] ([[green button]]) should be more explicit (feel I helped you here?)
3) complete the first demo of 
    a) creating new branch
    b) making commits
    c) reviewing/editing/merging the new branch
4) explain the mode of the git-hub interface; warn about multiple tabs/windows possibly losing data
5) showed that branch, commit and pull requests work together
6) the reviewing/editing/merging and accepting(/reject TBD) allows incremental builds(/collaboration)

Lesson 4:
1) exposed that I had an implicit asumption which was detailed explicitly 
2) introduced the 23 video series of git and git-hub tutorials
3) gave an over-view of the first several videos
4) gave notes on these videos reviewed

Lesson 5, also gave notes on these (8) videos reviewed.

Now, what is next? Why must we take so long?

Good time to experience https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk1UE-9qf0Q&list=PLg7s6cbtAD15G8lNyoaYDuKZSKyJrgwB-&index=11 for an 
overview of the complexity. In a nut shell, when the whole is broken into too many pieces, sometimes the meaning gets lost,
or in the video referenced-- changes the meaning altogether!

No, we're not there yet, but on this journey we are learning details of commands that help us do collaboration and revision 
control. Hopefully, patiently we shall learn the details with the end goal in mind. Namely, understanding how to work locally
and on the (remote) shared repository. We shall do it confidently and with better understanding.

Now a sneak peak. Lessons 6 to 8 will continue with notes as lessons 4 and 5 had done. However, you will revisit Lesson 3 and 
rehash the [[Read the guide]] by the commands in greater detail. A second refresher point beyond this one. Enjoy the ride!
