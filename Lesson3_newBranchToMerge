Wow, that was nice, once I went through all these steps from "Read the guide":
Step 2. Create a Branch
Step 3. Make a Commit
Step 4. Open a Pull Request
Step 5. Merge Pull Request

What I learned was a few key points that remove prior confusion.
1) The above 4 steps allow incorporating (merging) modification in stages (branch/Pull requests) with collaboration
2) Commits are "saves" to the file/branch/request "objects"
3) Having multiple windows open and in edit modes (before commit) could/will accidentally be missing.
4) Reading the mode of your web page helps you figure where you are in the process of coding/editing, sharing/reviewing
    and finally accepting(/rejecting or modifying) the changes
More on this screen below "Read the guide button", with slightly greyed background in day mode:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In your Git Hub base/repository name                            [UnWatch]     [Star]        [Fork]
<> Code  0 Issues  |] Pull requests > Actions [] Projects [] Wiki   4 Security L% Insights * Settings
=======-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
repos.Name/[Lesson3_newBranchToMerge] [CANCEL]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
{This file as I am in edit mode}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, lines 16 - 21 show the GitHub page coming to life for me. as I did steps 2-5 (lines 2-5 above)
NOTICE:
1) the Code page shown here as underscored with "=" is actually red in the web page
2) lines 16/17 show the mode you are in especially with the next line (19 above)
3) Now in edit mode 19 is: "git101/[Lesson3_newBranchtoMe] [Cancel]"
when in non-edit mode it's: "[main] Y Branch Tags       [GO TO FILE] [ADD FILE]  [[CODE]]"  ([[]] = green button)

Understanding this helped me use the GitHub page more easily and understand the "Read the Guide" lessons better.

Back continuing what I learned:
5) The branch, commit, and pull requests are methods that are taken to 
    make a change, save the change, and request review of the change.
TIP: while doing Steps 2 - 4 note that some of the buttons might vary, but if you take above lesson of reading
the GH screen and "Read the guide" words/instructions you will get through the end goal, realizing that the 
guiding principles are the same and these 3 steps work together for the last.

6) The Merge step allows review/edit of the changes, and the merging of changes into the main repository.
NOTE: So, my change was to make the lines added in the readme-edits to be lines 28-31 instead of 29-31.
    Seeing the changes as green adds was very nice. Also, after committing the merge, the branch was closed
    or deleted, and the adds went into the Readme.md original.
    
Time to celebrate!! Got a way better understanding of how to use my GitHub repository git101!!
