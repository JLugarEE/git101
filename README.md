# git101
GIT been gitten the best of me. So I'm going back to basic tutorial and attempting to get a better understanding of this wonderful tool.

Ever feel frustrated when trying to learn something new? That's git for me, at least right now.

I also bring my bias from years of experience with DOS file-folder systems and preferrences to use the command line. I also like visual
models that can help my understanding.

I often get frustrated that a new software or application package/interface doesn't fit the expectations I have, or think I have a firm
grip.

Add to that, my love of learning and my continuous desire to do more and better projects and ideas, and well you-- I mean me-- I get 
frustrated and equally humbled to get back to basics and the Manual. Read the manual. Start with the tutorial.

So, I begin... (12/25/2020)  What I'm nuts, but promise to work in the celebration! So, help me Lord! Any anybody else caring to follow along.
