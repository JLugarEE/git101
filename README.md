# git101
GIT been gitten the best of me. So I'm going back to basic tutorial and attempting to get a better understanding of this wonderful tool.

Ever feel frustrated when trying to learn something new? That's git for me, at least right now.

I also bring my bias from years of experience with DOS file-folder systems and preferrences to use the command line. I also like visual
models that can help my understanding.

I often get frustrated that a new software or application package/interface doesn't fit the expectations I have, or think I have a firm
grip.

Add to that, my love of learning and my continuous desire to do more and better projects and ideas, and well you-- I mean me-- I get 
frustrated and equally humbled to get back to basics and the Manual. Read the manual. Start with the tutorial.

So, I begin... (12/25/2020)  What I'm nuts, but promise to work in the celebration! So, help me Lord! Any anybody else caring to follow along.

December 26th update:
√ Family time celebrating the best Gift to man. (Check mark = Alt right keypad 251 on keyboard, since good ole DOS days)

√ Revisit Green button "Read the guide" notice immediately that a repository on making repositories will create confusion.

Moving forward, what can be done to reduce confusion and gain clarity:
1. Try to perform the demo as a series of lessons and perhaps clarity points, and avoid this built in duplicity of repository speak.
   Not knowing what that will look like yet, I contemplate, and might try a few.
   
2. Show the pit falls of OLD think. Not a fan of teaching what not to do. However, it's the murky mire I find myself in which is my MO.
3. Other. (When stumped by thought doing takes over.) Exploring 1-3...

Now, I happen to be editing the "Readme.md" file from the Newly created branch called "Readme-edits" from the Code View page (Green "CODE"
button on far right and the branch "Readme-edits" button on far left visible. So, I'm expecting a nearby commit to show only for the "feature"
Readme-edits for these three lines (#29-31).
