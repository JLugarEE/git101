So from the big Green button at top of GitHub "Read the guide" the lesson is broken down as follows:
Intro
What is GitHub?
Create a Repository
Create a Branch
Make a Commit
Open a Pull Request
Merge Pull Request

What I have had done already, before hitting the Big Green Button, was 
1) Created a new repository called "git101" 
    a) with a Readme.md file checked
    b) and edited it with the "mission" statement
    c) saved the changes via green commit button after edits
    
What I learned was that The Repository "git101" has already implemented:
1) the repository (see line 4 above)
2) the default branch main (see line 5)
3) perhaps a commit when I saved my edits to the Readme.md file (see line 6, and 14 or 1.c above)

So, LESSON 1 is half done! We did these steps from the web actions described in 1a - 1c. But it might 
not be so obvious unless you look out for it! We happen to be starting the lesson about the creation
of a repository while we have created one to store the journey. Hope you are with me. More on this 
shortly.

First, note the git definition/purpose: 
GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others 
work together on projects from anywhere.

This tutorial teaches you GitHub essentials like repositories, branches, commits, and Pull Requests.

Enough of that note, now, understand that having this repo git101 of creating repos. This Lesson1 file
is already completed through the first three steps. Plus we have this extra file!

So, now, is probably a good time to commit this file before doing the next steps:
Step 4. Open a Pull Request, and 
Step 5. Merge Pull Request
Step 6. CELEBRATE!!!
